            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The Transatlantic Slave Trade was a time in history when millions of people, mostly from West and Central Africa, were kidnapped from their homes, taken across the Atlantic Ocean on ships, and forced into a life of slavery in the Americas (like North and South America and the Caribbean). This trade lasted for about 400 years and was a terrible injustice that caused immense suffering.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 font-semibold text-accent-yellow">
                It is important to remember that these people were doctors, farmers, artists, and parents‚Äîthey were strong people who deserved to be free.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The journey across the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to the Americas was called the Middle Passage. This was the hardest part. The people were crammed onto ships, treated cruelly, and had very little food or water. Many became sick.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Despite the terrible conditions, these people showed incredible strength and resilience. They held onto their culture, their stories, and their hope for freedom.

                The injustice of slavery lasted for many years. Enslaved people and their descendants constantly resisted and fought for their freedom and human rights. Brave people stood up and fought to end slavery.

                    Between the 15th and 19th centuries, the Europeans took large numbers of enslaved people from West Africa to Europe and the Americas. This is known as the **Trans-Atlantic trade**. This trade was also known as the **triangular trade** because of the three-cornered route taken by the merchant ships: from Europe to West Africa to the Americas and back again to Europe.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The Europeans used several cruel and unjust reasons to justify this trade:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2 ml-4">
                    <li>The Europeans did not want to work on large, difficult plantations.</li>
                    <li>They thought that because of the heat and tropical diseases in North America and the West Indies, only Africans would be able to survive the harsh working conditions.</li>
                    <li>At first, Spain and Portugal traded slaves. Later, other Europeans joined in the terrible trade, including the first known English participant, John Hawkins, in 1562.</li>
