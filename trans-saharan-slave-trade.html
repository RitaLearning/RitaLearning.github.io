            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The <strong>Trans-Saharan Trade</strong> was a huge network of trade routes that crossed the vast Sahara Desert in Africa. "Trans-Saharan" just means "across the Sahara." For thousands of years, people loaded up goods and traveled in caravans to connect two very different parts of the continent: North Africa and West Africa.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 font-semibold text-sahara-gold">
                This trade was like a superhighway of its time, helping powerful kingdoms grow rich and allowing people to share ideas and culture.

                        Crossing the world's largest hot desert was incredibly difficult and dangerous. The travelers relied on the <strong>camel</strong>! Camels are often called the "ships of the desert" because they can travel long distances without water and carry heavy loads.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        Merchants and traders formed large groups called <strong>caravans</strong> to protect themselves from sandstorms and bandits. These caravans could have thousands of camels and travel for months.

                Two things were more important than anything else in this trade: <strong>Gold</strong> and <strong>Salt</strong>.

                    <p>West Africa had a huge supply of gold (often from regions like Ghana and Mali). North African and European markets desperately wanted it to make coins and jewelry.</p>
